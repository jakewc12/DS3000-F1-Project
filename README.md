# DS3000-F1-Project

This is a project to predict a driver based on given features, such as wins, points, max speed, and more. We utilize several sklearn models, such as SVM, Random Forest Classifier, and KNN to classify drivers. The data used for training this model is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data.
